        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            Hyper-Text-Markup-Language (aka HTML) is a markup language that is used to define the basic structure of
            any website. The basic structure consists of the header, body (main content), and footer of the website. And
            that is a markup language? Any language that is understood by the browser and which tells the browser how
            to render the data is known as a markup language.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is used for defining the structure of all the content of a web page or a collection of web pages (website).
            Now, HTML is all about tags! Tag is the most basic unit of an HTML webpage. HTML contains several tags
            for different specific purposes. These tags provide display information to the browser, meaning each tag has
            predefined display information, e.g., &it;a&gt; tag defines hyperlink which is used to navigate to other web pages.
            Have you ever thought about how many tags HTML has in total? HTML has 132 tags in total. It contains tags
            like &it;h1&gt; - &it;h6&gt; for headings, &it;p&gt; for paragraphs headings etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are also different fonts and choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a
            website. You can find more about the fonts <a href="fonts.html">here</a>.

        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
            <li>
                HTML is not case-sensitive language, meaning &it;html&gt; is equivalent to &it;HTML&gt;.
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML is platform independent because we can view it on any operating system.
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML follows a tree like structure. Html tag acts as a root element, then head and body tags act as child
                elements of head tag, and so on. 
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML language is easy to understand and learn.
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML tags contain display information (or render information) that is useful to browsers like Chrome,
                Firefox, etc.

        <h2>Difference Between HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
            HTML and CSS is a way by which you can create awesome looking websites on your own. Both HTML and
            CSS go together in building or developing a web page of any website, but both serve a very different and unique
            purpose. 
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML and CSS are the fundamental blocks of any website. So, if youâ€™re thinking of becoming a web developer
            you must have knowledge of these two languages. But having great knowledge is not enough. You must be
            aware of the main differences between HTML and CSS.
